# Cat Data Schema
Repository containing an ETL pipeline and a data model for data storage using sqlalchemy, alembic, and postgresql.

## What does this program do?
The program acts as a data ingestion mechanism, monitoring the `CAT_DATA_DMZ` directory for new CSV files. When a new file is detected, the program imports the data into the designated database defined by the `DATABASE_URL` configuration in `config.py`.<br>

This program can be set up as a service running in the background, so it will always be running. <br>

## Building the Project from Source
### Before building, make sure:
- The postgres database is set up with the target role, database, and password (should match `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`).
- (Optional) [The metabase service](https://github.com/emma-jinger/Set-Up-a-Service-on-Ubuntu) has been configured, with the metabase unit file located at `/etc/systemd/system/metabase.service` and the service environment variable file at `/etc/default/metabase`, defining its setup. This configuration allows for effortless data viewing.  

### Set up a virtual environment on the server (optional)
Create a virtual environment `cat_data_pipeline_venv` using the command `python3 -m venv cat_data_pipeline_venv`

### Cloning the Repo   
To download the code, navigate to your working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/emma-jinger/LitterLog-DataPipeline
```

### Verify Database Info  
- Edit `sqlalchemy.url` in `CatDataSchema/alembic.ini` to match the `DATABASE_URL` defined in the `.env` under the directory `CatDataSchema`.
- Database information in the Metabase service file `/etc/default/matabase` should also match the `DATABASE_URL` defined in the `.env`, if the serice is to be set up.
 
### Install the `CatDataSchema` Package from the Project Root
```
pip install -e . 
```
*Refer to [Make-a-Python-Package](https://github.com/emma-jinger/Make-a-Python-Package) to read more about working with Python packages.*

### Run the application `cat_data_watcher` to test the ETL pipeline
```
cat_data_watcher
``` 
*Note: cat_data_watcher can be [set up as a service](https://github.com/emma-jinger/Set-Up-a-Service-on-Ubuntu) so that this app will always be running in the background.*

### Check data from Metabase or the database
Go to the address `http://192.168.1.157:3000` to access the Metabase interface to see the data if Metabase serviceis set up.

You can also check to see the data from the actual database with the following commands:
```bash
psql -U your_postgres_user your_postgres_db -h 127.0.0.1 -W # type in the password when prompted
```
Once you are in the database, see all the schema and tables with this psql command: 
```psql
\dt *.*
```

## Running the Docker Container (Written on 20221108, not tested after writing)
Below is the diagram that explains the docker compose set up.
![catdat_docker_diagram](https://github.com/emma-jinger/cat_data/blob/main/Diagrams/catdata_docker_diagram.png)

### Build the Docker Image
Build our docker image `cat_data_watcher:latest` by running: 
```
sudo ./build.sh
```
Check if the `cat_data_watcher:latest` has been built by running:
```
sudo docker images
```
### Spin up the containers (metabase, postgres, nginx, and cat_data_watcher)
Before using docker compose to spin the containers up, modify `DATABASE_URL` in `CatDataSchema/config.py` and `sqlalchemy.url` in `CatDataSchema/alembic.ini` to match the `DATABASE_URL` in `prod-docker-compose.yml`: 
```postgresql+psycopg2://metabase_catwatcher_user:metabase_catwatcher_pw@db:5432/metabase_catwatcher_db```

Spin up the container with the commands: 
```
cd docker 
sudo docker compose -f prod-docker-compose.yml up
```
*Note: The -f option allows you to specify the name and location of the Compose file to use for starting the Docker containers.*
### Check the data on Metabase. 
Go to the browser using `http://192.168.1.157:3001`, you should be able to see cat data whenever there is a new file generated. 


## Additional feature to add 
- Make a PYPI server and push my package to the server (Write a guide as well)
