"""
This module contains two command line scripts, 'cat_data_watcher' and 'migrate', that can be executed via terminal.

'cat_data_watcher' monitors a specified directory (the directory is either the value of the environment variable 'CAT_DATA_DMZ' or, 
if the environment variable is not set, the default value '/var/nfs/cat_watcher_output') and calls the 'file_watcher' function from the etl module 
whenever a file is created or modified in the directory.

'migrate' runs the Alembic database migration using the 'alembic.ini' configuration file located in the same directory as this module. The Alembic migration scripts
are located in a directory named 'alembic' in the same directory as this module. This script will upgrade the database to the latest migration version.

Both scripts are added as entry points in the package's setup.py file.
